Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Check/update ReleaseNote initializer file (config/initializers/release_notes.rb).
      At a minimum you may want to update the app_name... or not...

  2. Create a ReleaseNote model by running:

      rails g release_notes ReleaseNote

  3. Migrate your newly created ReleaseNote model:

      rake db:migrate

  4. You can copy ReleaseNotes views (for customization) to your app by running:

       rails g release_notes:views
